## Peer-graded Assignment: R Markdown and Leaflet
Jason Chen

Create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet.

Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities.

Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a map created with Leaflet. We would love to see you show off your creativity!

```{r}
library(leaflet)
## Warning: package 'leaflet' was built under R version 3.3.2
my_map <- leaflet() %>% addTiles() 
my_map <- my_map %>% addMarkers(lat=-26.158632, lng= 27.903283, popup="My Laboratory")
my_map

```
